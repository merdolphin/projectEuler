Project Euler

============

Here mainly use C++ to solve those problems in Project Euler.

In the future, I will switch to Java. 

It will keep on updating when I have some time on weekend. 

Please note that these with _1.C, _2.C, _3.C correspond to the version 1, version 2 and version 3. 

Version 1 basically is built on brute-force way, its only elegance is to waste computer time.

Version 2 and Version 3 use some algorithms. All those algorithms and proofs can be found online.

Please also note that those without "End: data" are those un-finished.
 
 
To be continue ...
