Project Euler

============

Here mainly use C/C++ to solve those problems in Project Euler.

Please note that those with _1.C, _2.C, _3.C correspond to the version 1, version 2 and version 3. 

Version 1 basically is built on brute-force way, its only elegance is to waste computer time.

Version 2 and Version 3 use some algorithms. All those algorithms and proofs can be found from wikipedia.
