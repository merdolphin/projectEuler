Project Euler

============

Here mainly use C/C++ to solve those problems in Project Euler.

Please note that those with _1.C, _2.C, _3.C correspond to the version 1, version 2 and version 3. 

Version 1 basically is built on brute-force way, its only elegance is to waste computer time.

Version 2 and Version 3 use some algorithms. All those algorithms and proofs can be found from wikipedia.

Please kindly note that those without "End: data" are those un-finished.
 
I am occupied by lots of other things, so I can only spare few time on it.

I guess it needs one year to finish.
 
To be continue ... when I get time.
